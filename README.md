# FlipperZeroEuropeanPortals
A repository of portals I made for the Evil Portal app on the Flipper Zero. For educational purposes only!

It now consists of 2 well known internet providers "Hotspots" to emulate. (well at least they are well known where I live)

I will be working on more and am open for suggestions!

!! THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS FOR EACH PORTAL !!

One has a fake "Forgot credentials" button that will invite people to go to their provider's app if they forgot their creds.
The other doesn't have this option.

If you do not know how to use this great app which is Evil Portal, watch Talking Sasquach's tutorial: https://youtu.be/zfd7wADSkD4
