# FlipperZeroEuropeanPortals
A repository of portals I made for the Evil Portal app on the Flipper Zero. For educational purposes only!

It now consists of 2 well known internet providers "Hotspots" to emulate. (well at least they are well known where I live)

I will be working on more and am open for suggestions!

!!THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS TO EACH PORTAL!!
One has a fake "Forgot credentials" button that will invite people to go to their provider's app if they forgot their creds.
The other doesn't have this option.
