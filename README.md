### Portal Features:
- 🌐 Each portal comes in **TWO VERSIONS**:
  1. One with a **pseudo "Forgot credentials"** button to guide users to their provider's app – adding a touch of authenticity.
  2. A straightforward version without the aforementioned option.

- 🌍 Multilingual Support: Some portals are available in native languages for enhanced realism!
