# FlipperZeroEuropeanPortals
A repository of portals I made for the Evil Portal app on the Flipper Zero. For educational purposes only!

It now consists of a few well known internet providers "Hotspots" to emulate. (well at least they are well known where I live)

I will be working on more and am open for suggestions!

!! THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS FOR EACH PORTAL !!

One has a fake "Forgot credentials" button that will invite people to go to their provider's app if they forgot their creds.
The other doesn't have this option.

If you do not know how to use this great app which is Evil Portal, watch Talking Sasquach's tutorial: https://youtu.be/zfd7wADSkD4
In a nutshell, after installing Evil Portal on your Flipper (can be done easily through flipc.org):

1 Open QFlipper

2 Browse to SD Card > apps_data > evil_portal

3 There, you must upload the two files you find for each portal (index.html and ap.config.txt)

4 Now, you can Start Portal in the Evil Portal app using a WiFi dev board (official or not, doesn't matter)

5 The portal you will see by connecting to yor access point will be the one for the provider you uploaded the files from!

If you want to change the Access Point's name, you can do it simply by editing the ap.config.txt file
You can also tweak the indexes a bit if you know some HTML (there is some JS on the "ForgotCredentials" files)

Happy flippin'
