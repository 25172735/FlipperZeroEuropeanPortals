This one emulates a portal for a McDonald's "Free Hotspot" using EvilPortal on your Flipper Zero.
It will "require" a Google account to log into.

!!FOR EDUCATIONAL USES ONLY!!

The HTML in the "WithForgotCredentials" file contains a "forgot credentials" button on the user side to make it look more realistic. This button only shows a message inviting them to go on their provider's app if they forgot their login/password.

Happy flippin'
